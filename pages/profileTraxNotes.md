## ✅ Pattern Recognition in Routes
- **Common Flow for Routes**: Verification ➜ Error Handling ➜ Logic Execution.
- This helps keep code clean and predictable.

## ✅ PostModal Improvements
- Plan included:
  1. Add profile pictures to comments.
  2. Add name of the poster.
  3. Heart/save icon animations and size.
  4. Comment box.
  5. Scrollable comments for testing UI.

## ✅ useState with Functional Updates
- Example: `setShowDropdown(prev => !prev)`
- **Reasoning**: Using the functional form ensures you always toggle based on the most up-to-date previous value, avoiding bugs caused by stale state.

## ✅ `selectedBubbleId` for Scoped Dropdowns
- **Problem**: Multiple dropdowns were rendering or ghosting due to global boolean `showDropdown`.
- **Fix**: Used `selectedBubbleId` instead, which scopes open dropdown to a specific `bubble_id`.

```jsx
<BsThreeDots onClick={() => setSelectedBubbleId(prev => prev === bubble.bubble_id ? null : bubble.bubble_id)} />
{selectedBubbleId === bubble.bubble_id && <div className="dropdown-menu">...</div>}
```

## ✅ CSS Positioning for Dropdowns
- Placed dropdown next to the 3-dots by using `position: absolute` inside a relatively positioned container.
- Ensured z-index was high enough to stay on top.
- CSS Tip: `position: relative` on `.bubble-item` ensures the dropdown aligns with that card.

## ✅ Dropdown Bugs and Fixes
### Issues Faced:
1. Dropdown not clickable.
2. Appeared in top-right instead of per bubble.
3. Clicking 3 dots triggered dropdown, but a duplicate rendered globally.
4. Hover behavior caused dropdowns to pop open unexpectedly.

### Fix Summary:
- Used `selectedBubbleId` logic to ensure only one dropdown appears.
- Wrapped conditional dropdown render inside the bubble component’s scope.
- Ensured styles didn’t default to `display: none` when React state intended to show it.
- Debugged using `console.log("Dropdown is rendered!")` and inspected DOM.
- Hover behavior removed—made click-controlled instead.

## ✅ New Debug Strategy
- Always copy unstable or experimental changes into a `debug.js` file before modifying main files.
- Makes it easier to trace back missteps if something breaks.

## ✅ Post-Help-Learning (PHL)
- Every time help is needed on a new file, note what caused the struggle and how to fix it.
- This builds your internal wiki and helps you debug future issues faster.

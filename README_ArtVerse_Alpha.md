## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the **Trax Method** — a project-based learning approach combining multiple-choice guidance, active recall, step-by-step debugging, and written documentation. Every bug solved became a learning checkpoint. Every breakthrough was documented for future reference.

This method was simulated through AI mentorship, where guidance was delivered in a mentor-student format — not just providing answers, but provoking problem-solving, reflection, and independent documentation.

ArtVerse Alpha wasn’t just built — it was learned into existence.
